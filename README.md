Discharge tracking app.

Notes:
* 2/10/2016: This is just a skeleton at the moment. It won't be able to run.
* 3/25/2016: Runable skeleton with models made and index pages for views (but the controller needs to be built).
* 4/10/2016: Runable demo with surveys, triggers, responses (but only survey data collection working).
* 6/10/2016: Triggers working to SMS, email, phone, and URLs (but no trigger data collection yet).
* 7/23/2016: You can now take surveys by SMS and phone (as well as email of course as always).
* 7/23/2016: Autocomplete now works!
