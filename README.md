COVID-19 tracking app, and more!

## Installation

```bash
~/medtracker $ pip install pipenv
~/medtracker $ pipenv install --dev
~/medtracker $ cp medtracker/config.py.example medtracker/config.py
```

This will set up a minimal configuration which uses a SQLite database located in the `medtracker` directory.

## Usage

```bash
~/medtracker $ pipenv shell
(medtracker) ~/medtracker $ ./run.py
```

## Testing

Because of how `pytest` handles the Python path, we run into a
`ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to run `pytest` from the root directory.
`run_tests.sh` sets the Python path properly before calling `pytest`.

```bash
~/medtracker $ ./run_tests.sh
```

You can pass any arguments you'd normally pass to `pytest`:

```bash
~/medtracker $ ./run_tests.sh -h # get help
~/medtracker $ ./run_tests.sh -k "test_login" # only run tests for this pattern
```
